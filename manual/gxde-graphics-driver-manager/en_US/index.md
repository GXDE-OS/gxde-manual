### Intel Graphics Driver Management
If your computer only has one Intel graphics card, the default driver is recommended with better performance and poor compatibility.

1. On GXDE Graphics Driver Manager interface, select the driver solution for your graphics card.
2. Click on **Switch** to switch.
3. Click on **Reboot** to install the new driver.
